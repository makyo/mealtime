Do you have mealtimes?

They happen to all of us.

Do you have **loud ones** with **lots of pictures?**

Sweet. Feel free to contribute! Maddy has just a few rules:

1. Niceness: you may tease or insult ingredients, but not the resulting dish, and *never* the reader/cook.
2. Jokes: no \*phobic jokes. Joke about, for instance, onions being too loud, tomatoes on the vine being lazy, etc.
3. Ingredients: ovo-lactic vegetarian dishes only. You don't need to be a vegetarian --- Maddy isn't --- but the goal is to show off good food that lots of people can eat. Vegan, raw, slow, probiotic, etc. are fine, but not required.
4. Pictures: take lots of pictures, more than you think you'll use, because some will be trimmed out. Try to have stuff in focus, but don't worry too much otherwise.
5. Recipes: provide an actual recipe along with the hollering. You can be goofy with it (e.g: `garlic: like a billion`), but do provide one.
