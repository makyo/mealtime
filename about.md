I'm not, like, a super good cook or anything. Not a chef.

My dad tried to hammer home that if I learned how to cook, I'd get girls fawning all over me and find a good wife. Which, like, whatever; I got married to a guy and then transitioned from husband to wife, but I still love cooking.

I buried myself in food. I went to school for music, and kept cooking. I started working in tech, and kept cooking. I cook because I like to; I cook because it's cheap; I cook because I live in a town that can't seem to keep anything but contemporary American restaurants in business.

I cook because food is **so good.**

**I dunno, I just really love food.**

## BOOK?????

**Yeah, there's a book coming, but you'll have to wait jeez.**

## WHY AM I YELLING

**IF YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE SOMETHING, LOVE IT EARNESTLY AND LOVE IT LOUD.**
